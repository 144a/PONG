# PONG

Now, this isn't any old pong game. Its a horribly slow, but this, I believe, is almost the least number of lines for a pong game in ti basic. One line for initializing values, one start the loop, one to compute ball and paddle position, two to print both the ball and paddle, and one to end the loop. I believe that a 5 line version is possible, but 1) it would have an incredibly long print statement 2) require more calculation for ball and paddle position. So, I guess this is where I am at until I have more time to try again. 

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
